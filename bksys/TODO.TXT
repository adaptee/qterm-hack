generic
-------

1	n	Add the configuration variables into another environment called "config"
		and not into "env" directly.
		The reason is that scons makes deep copies of everything and that
		'env' needs to be duplicated for every new obj.

2	n	extend bksys help option to display options defined set by the opts.AddOptions() 
		this provides old configure help options list (used by 4) 
			-> move help printing after opts.Update(env)
			-> add "print opts.GenerateHelpText(env)" before return 

3	n	dcop, kdecore and other test apps require RUNTESTS to be compiled, currently there 
		is no support for this 
		
-	n	implement library dependency support like libtool does, required for static libraries 
		and uninstalled shared (from kde-buildsystem@kde.org)

-	n	cleanup QT related component definition
		QT is something like QT + zlib, QTGUI is QtCore + QTGui

-	n	find a platform independent way to include all symbols from static libraries into a 
    shared library (gcc-notation: -Wl,--whole-archive ... -Wl,--no-whole-archive )

- n cleanup multiple definitions of command line options like PREFIX, which is defined in generic.py, kde3.py and qt4.py
